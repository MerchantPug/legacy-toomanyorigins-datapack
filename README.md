# Legacy TooManyOrigins Datapack
This is the repository for the Legacy TooManyOrigins datapack, I made this repository because I couldn't include the pack inside the Forge 1.19.2 version of TooManyOrigins' rework beta without it being automatically enabled.

The pack should be included inside any other versions of the TooManyOrigins beta.

This repository also includes branches for each individual origin.

## Installation Instructions
Put any datapack that you want in your world's `datapacks` folder, just like any other datapack.
