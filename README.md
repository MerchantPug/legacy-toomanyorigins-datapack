# Legacy TooManyOrigins Datapack
This is the repository for the Legacy TooManyOrigins datapack, I made this repository because I couldn't include the pack inside the Forge 1.19.2 version of TooManyOrigins' rework beta without it being automatically enabled.

This pack should be included inside any other versions of the TooManyOrigins beta.

There are two flavours of this [repo](https://github.com/MerchantPug/legacy-toomanyorigins-datapack/):
- `/main` which includes the datapack at the root directory with everything in it, this is submoduled into TooManyOrigins 1.0.0 and above.
- `/individual` which includes each individual datapack for each individual origin, if you'd like a specific origin's old version instead of all of them, they will be contained here.

## Installation Instructions
Put any datapack that you want in your world's `datapacks` folder, just like any other datapack.

Unzip the datapack if you've gotten it through GitHub's Download ZIP functionality.
